# KInD
The Knowledge and Intelligence Design (KInD) research group in the Design Engineering (DE) department at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) focuses on the relationship between the science and practice of design, and the digital technology that fuels intelligent products, services, and systems.

<!-- ## What we do -->
The Knowledge and Intelligence Design group aims at empowering designers and other stakeholders in the design process with intelligent methods and tools for the design, understanding, and control of products, services and systems (PSSs) that are knowledge- and intelligence-centric, fit for purpose, and that support human and societal values. 

<!-- ## How we do it -->
By integrating research in design with research in data science, Internet of Things, machine learning, spatial analysis, and crowd computing, we envision a future where:
* [Scalable Design] Designers and all relevant stakeholders can meaningfully, systematically, and concretely collaborate in the design of intelligent PSSs that are fit for purpose and that support human and societal values. To this end, we study and develop collective intelligence tools that are scalable, accessible and inclusive, thus enriching the diversity of perspectives that inform design processes.
* [Knowledge-Centric Design] Data produced by PSSs are used to continuously and iteratively inspire, inform, and evaluate the design of intelligent products and services in a responsible manner. Technology and society evolve at an increasingly accelerated pace. Therefore, we develop design methods and tools to support the dynamic evolution of digital PSSs to ensure sustainable value generation.
* [Impact-Driven Design] Impact and social utility are the main driving forces of the design and development of design of intelligent PSSs. Therefore, we develop data- and knowledge-rich methods and tools to enable the systematic analysis of measurable outcomes and impacts of intelligent PSSs in society.

<!-- ## Why we do it -->
From large-scale digital content processing to digital infrastructures for intelligent cities, and  from autonomous consumer products, to automated vehicles; the pervasive adoption of digital technology for automatic and data-driven decision making is creating complex societal issues that demand human-centered and cross-disciplinary efforts. 
Design is a broad integrative discipline that draws upon the knowledge developed in almost every academic field. At the same time, design has the capacity to identify the complexity of issues, predict its evolution, and provide practical and useful solutions that address the needs of all the involved stakeholders. 

<!-- ## Where we do it -->
The research of the Knowledge and Intelligence Design group finds application in several domains where knowledge- and intelligence-centric PSSs are having tangible and measurable impact: 
* Intelligent Cities
* Smart Culture
* Health
* Mobility
* Sustainability
